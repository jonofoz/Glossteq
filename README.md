# Glossteq
A simple glossary for quick definitions in a sea of tech definitions!

---

Howdy! JonOfOz here 😀

This will be the future home of an easy-to-access, generalized glossary of tech terminology. Think simple Wikipedia, but for tech.

The Plan So Far (in lieu of using GitHub Projects right now)
------------------------------------------------------------

Glossteq should eventually become a cross-platform app with a heavy focus on 
1. getting in 
2. getting what you need
3. getting out

Just for fun I'm thinking I'll do this in Vue + Quasar. I had gotten a _little_ bit into Vue before but we never took off and that bothers me.
